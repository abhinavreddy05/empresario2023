        <h1>What is Business Model Competition?</h1>
        <p>
            Empresario represents a radical departure from the past and the crest of a new paradigm in entrepreneurship. Empresario is not a business plan competition. Rather than focusing on developing a robust business plan, complete with financials and slick presentations, business model competition focuses on identifying and precisely defining the assumptions of the new venture, testing those assumptions in the field, and then pivoting (changing) based on the lessons learned. It rewards entrepreneurs fo
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Breaking down ideas into key business model assumptions.
            Getting outside the building and testing their assumptions with customers.
            Applying customer development and lean startup principles to nail the solution.
            Learning to pivot (change) until arrival at a customer-validated business model.</p>

        <h1>How does a Business Model differ from a traditional Business Plan?</h1>
        <p>
            The International Business Model Competition is about recognizing that any new venture is just a guess at a problem / solution and the only valid way to test whether those guesses are right is to “get outside the building” and start working with customers. So what exactly is the difference between a business model and a business plan?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Outside versus Inside the Building:</strong> Most business plans are written using library research. Successful business models are achieved through talking to customers and making changes based on feedback from those conversations.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Input versus Output Focus:</strong> The goal is to identify your assumptions and turn them into facts by getting outside the building. And when a startup has done this, the story is compelling and it is an awesome one to tell because it is based on facts. Validated learning about what customers reallywant is the stuff a business model is made of and music to the ears of potential investors.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Change versus Fortify:</strong>Most business plans attempt to fortify/prove the core idea with evidence. Judges of the Empresario will be looking for instances where teams learned they were wrong and made a pivot in a new and right direction. Your application should focus on the lessons learned and “pivots” made—the more the better.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Chasing Customers versus Chasing Funding:</strong> Let’s face it, many business plans are written to raise money. Unfortunately the business plan formula doesn’t capture the answers VCs most want to see: real validation you can make a product customers want. Instead of chasing the money, chase customers. Getting into the field you will validate the model and raising money will be relatively easy.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Launching versus Talking:</strong> Business plans often talk about what will happen in the future. Empresario is about what you learned by applying a Customer Development / Lean Startup / Nail It then Scale It process.</p>

                The International Business Model Competition is about recognizing that any new venture is just a guess at a problem / solution and the only valid way to test whether those guesses are right is to “get outside the building” and start working with customers. So what exactly is the difference between a business model and a business plan?

            <p><strong>Outside versus Inside the Building:</strong> Most business plans are written using library research. Successful business models are achieved through talking to customers and making changes based on feedback from those conversations.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Input versus Output Focus:</strong> The goal is to identify your assumptions and turn them into facts by getting outside the building. And when a startup has done this, the story is compelling and it is an awesome one to tell because it is based on facts. Validated learning about what customers reallywant is the stuff a business model is made of and music to the ears of potential investors.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Change versus Fortify:</strong>Most business plans attempt to fortify/prove the core idea with evidence. Judges of the Empresario will be looking for instances where teams learned they were wrong and made a pivot in a new and right direction. Your application should focus on the lessons learned and “pivots” made—the more the better.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Chasing Customers versus Chasing Funding:</strong> Let’s face it, many business plans are written to raise money. Unfortunately the business plan formula doesn’t capture the answers VCs most want to see: real validation you can make a product customers want. Instead of chasing the money, chase customers. Getting into the field you will validate the model and raising money will be relatively easy.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Launching versus Talking:</strong> Business plans often talk about what will happen in the future. Empresario is about what you learned by applying a Customer Development / Lean Startup / Nail It then Scale It process.</p>
