            <p>
                Empresario represents a radical departure from the past and the crest of a new paradigm in
                entrepreneurship. Empresario is not a business plan competition. Rather than focusing on developing a
                robust business plan, complete with financials and slick presentations, business model competition
                focuses on identifying and precisely defining the assumptions of the new venture, testing those
                assumptions in the field, and then pivoting (changing) based on the lessons learned. It rewards

        </div>

        <div class="struct ele">
            <h1>How does a Business Model differ from a traditional Business Plan?</h1>
            <p>
                The International Business Model Competition is about recognizing that any new venture is just a guess
                at a problem / solution and the only valid way to test whether those guesses are right is to “get
                outside the building” and start working with customers. So what exactly is the difference between a
                business model and a business plan?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Outside versus Inside the Building:</strong> Traditional business plans often rely on secondary
                research, market reports, and internal analysis to gather information about the market and potential
                customers. However, this approach can lead to assumptions based on incomplete or outdated data. The lean
                startup methodology, however, encourages entrepreneurs to actively engage with customers early on. By
                having direct conversations, conducting interviews, and observing customer behavior, startups can gain
                valuable insights and feedback that inform the development of their business model.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Input versus Output Focus:</strong> Traditional business plans tend to focus on input-based
                assumptions, where entrepreneurs make educated guesses about customers' preferences, market demand, and
                strategies. These assumptions are often treated as facts without being tested. The lean startup approach
                emphasizes an output-focused mindset. It aims to transform assumptions into facts by actively seeking
                customer feedback and validating hypotheses through experiments and real-world data. This iterative
                feedback loop allows startups to continuously refine their business model based on actual customer
                responses and behavior, increasing the chances of creating a product or service that customers truly
                want.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Change versus Fortify:</strong>Traditional business plans often seek to fortify the core idea or
                concept by gathering evidence, conducting market research, and providing extensive justifications. These
                plans are often presented as a static document that attempts to convince the idea's viability. In
                contrast, the lean startup approach embraces a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. It
                recognizes that initial assumptions may be flawed or incomplete and encourages startups to be open to
                change. Rather than seeing a pivot or change in direction as a failure, it is viewed as a natural part
                of the learning process.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Chasing Customers versus Chasing Funding:</strong>Traditional business plans often focus on
                attracting funding as a primary goal. Entrepreneurs may spend a significant amount of time crafting
                their plans to impress potential investors and secure financing. In contrast, the lean startup approach
                encourages startups to prioritize customer acquisition and validation over fundraising. By focusing on
                getting into the field, engaging with customers, and delivering a product or service that meets their
                needs, you can demonstrate real-world validation and traction.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Launching versus Talking:</strong> Traditional business plans are often centered around future
                projections, forecasts, and plans. They lay out a roadmap for what the business intends to do without
                necessarily validating those assumptions through real-world feedback. In contrast, the lean startup
                methodology emphasizes the importance of taking action and launching early. Startups actively engage in
                customer development, gathering insights, and iterating their products or services based on validated
                learning. This emphasis on tangible actions and outcomes positions the startup to learn and adapt
                quickly, ultimately increasing your chances of success.</p>

            <p><strong>Find a Problem:</strong> Find a big customer problem worth solving and write down all your key
                hypotheses about the business model to solve this problem. We recommend that you use Alex Osterwalder’s

            <br />
            <p><strong>Nail the Solution:</strong> Develop a minimum viable product prototype and get outside the
                building face-to-face with customers to test your vision of the solution. Pivot when you discover you
                are wrong. Re-peat these tests until you nail the solution.</p>

            <h1>Business Model Canvas</h1>
            <p>
                The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic management tool to quickly and easily define and
                communicate a business idea or concept. It is a one page document which works through the fundamental
                elements of a business or product, structuring an idea in a coherent way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> What’s compelling about the proposition? Why do customers buy, use?
                It is the fundamental concept of the exchange of value between your business and your customer/clients.
                Generally, value is exchanged from a customer for money when a problem is solved or a pain is relieved
                for them by your business.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Customer Segments:</strong> Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do? Customer
                Segmenting is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in
                specific ways, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Channels:</strong>How are these propositions promoted, sold and delivered? Why? Is it working?
                Channels are defined as the avenues through which your customer comes into contact with your business
                and becomes part of your sales cycle. This is generally covered under the marketing plan for your
                business.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Customer Relationships:</strong> How do you interact with the customer through their ‘journey’?
                Customer Relationships is defined as how a business interacts with its customers. So, do you meet with
                them in person? Or over the phone? Or is your business predominantly run online so the relationship will
                be online too?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Revenue Streams:</strong> How does the business earn revenue from the value propositions? Revenue
                Streams are defined as the way by which your business converts your Value Proposition or solution to the
                customer’s problem into financial gain.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Key Activities:</strong>What uniquely strategic things does the business do to deliver its
                proposition?
                The Key Activities of your business/product are the actions that your business undertakes to achieve the
                value proposition for your customers.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Key Resources:</strong>What unique strategic assets must the business have to compete?
                Key means the resources your business requires to do business. These resources are what is needed
                practically to undertake the action/activities of your business:</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Key Partnerships:</strong>What can the company not do so it can focus on its Key Activities? If
                my business cannot achieve the value proposition alone, who else do I need to rely on to do it
                Key Partners are a list of other external companies/suppliers/parties you may need to achieve your key
                activities and deliver value to the customer.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Cost Structure:</strong>What are the business’ major cost drivers? How are they linked to
                revenue?
                Your business cost structure is defined as the monetary cost of operating as a business.</p>

            <h1>Patents</h1>
            <p>
                When inventors come up with a new device, the first thing they want to do is patent it. Patents are
                enforceable rights in a particular jurisdiction given to an inventor to exclude others from using,
                making or selling their invention. For a certain period of time, patent-holders are allowed to control
                how their inventions are used, allowing them to reap the financial rewards of their work. Patents are a
                palpable, legally-binding manifestation of a person's genius and innovation; they allow a person to
                actually own an INVENTION.
                One can obtain a patent by filing a patent application in a prescribed format in any one of the four
                patent offices in India. Patent application will result in defining your rights over the invention and
                how broadly you have protected your invention. Even simple words in patent application can change your
                right over the scope of invention drastically. Patent attorneys or patent agents are the best people to
                write and draft your application. Filing an invention in India will give you a right only in India as
                patent right is jurisdictional in nature. One has to file patent applications in other countries
                wherever he/she feels the invention needs to be protected.

            </p>
            <br />
            <!-- <p><strong>Outside versus Inside the Building:</strong> Most business plans are written using library research. Successful business models are achieved through talking to customers and making changes based on feedback from those conversations.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Input versus Output Focus:</strong> The goal is to identify your assumptions and turn them into facts by getting outside the building. And when a startup has done this, the story is compelling and it is an awesome one to tell because it is based on facts. Validated learning about what customers reallywant is the stuff a business model is made of and music to the ears of potential investors.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Change versus Fortify:</strong>Most business plans attempt to fortify/prove the core idea with evidence. Judges of the Empresario will be looking for instances where teams learned they were wrong and made a pivot in a new and right direction. Your application should focus on the lessons learned and “pivots” made—the more the better.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Chasing Customers versus Chasing Funding:</strong> Let’s face it, many business plans are written to raise money. Unfortunately the business plan formula doesn’t capture the answers VCs most want to see: real validation you can make a product customers want. Instead of chasing the money, chase customers. Getting into the field you will validate the model and raising money will be relatively easy.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Launching versus Talking:</strong> Business plans often talk about what will happen in the future. Empresario is about what you learned by applying a Customer Development / Lean Startup / Nail It then Scale It process.</p> -->

                The International Business Model Competition is about recognizing that any new venture is just a guess
                at a problem / solution and the only valid way to test whether those guesses are right is to “get
                outside the building” and start working with customers. So what exactly is the difference between a
                business model and a business plan?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Outside versus Inside the Building:</strong> Most business plans are written using library
                research. Successful business models are achieved through talking to customers and making changes based
                on feedback from those conversations.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Input versus Output Focus:</strong> The goal is to identify your assumptions and turn them into
                facts by getting outside the building. And when a startup has done this, the story is compelling and it
                is an awesome one to tell because it is based on facts. Validated learning about what customers
                reallywant is the stuff a business model is made of and music to the ears of potential investors.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Change versus Fortify:</strong>Most business plans attempt to fortify/prove the core idea with
                evidence. Judges of the Empresario will be looking for instances where teams learned they were wrong and
                made a pivot in a new and right direction. Your application should focus on the lessons learned and
                “pivots” made—the more the better.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Chasing Customers versus Chasing Funding:</strong> Let’s face it, many business plans are written
                to raise money. Unfortunately the business plan formula doesn’t capture the answers VCs most want to
                see: real validation you can make a product customers want. Instead of chasing the money, chase
                customers. Getting into the field you will validate the model and raising money will be relatively easy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Launching versus Talking:</strong> Business plans often talk about what will happen in the
                future. Empresario is about what you learned by applying a Customer Development / Lean Startup / Nail It
                then Scale It process.</p>
