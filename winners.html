                    <p>Shortcast is a social micro-podcast app that aims to increase the usage of audio as a means of communication. It does this by eliminating the inefficiencies of editing, mixing, transcribing, hosting, distribution and all the in-between steps that go into creating a podcast, and allows the user to record audio on their phone and upload it, in a two step process, and thereby enables the user to express their thoughts and ideas anonymously with ease.</p>
